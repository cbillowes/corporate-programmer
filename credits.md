Without John Sonmez at [simpleprogrammer.com](http://simpleprogrammer.com/)
and his free 3 week e-mail course to [boost](http://devcareerboost.com/blog-course/)
your software development career, this blog would not have materialized. Thanks John!

A big shout out goes to all the people who have contributed to the
technologies I used in order to make this website.
Without all of you, my site would probably consist of Comic Sans and
Times New Roman. Say what?! o_O
