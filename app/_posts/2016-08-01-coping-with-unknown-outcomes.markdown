As software developers we have a lot of things that build unnecessary stress
and anxiety in each day of our profession - just to mention a few and in no
particular order:

* Collaborating with different types of personalities
* Dealing with conflict
* Estimating effort
* Managing expectations
* Choosing the right technologies
* Working on legacy repositories
* Fighting fires in production

In many cases we don't know what the outcome of a situation will be. Although
this applies to all aspects of life, dealing with the unknown only amplifies
the stresses that build.

A mentor introduced me to these three questions I could ask myself (and write
down the answers to) when I find myself in a stressful situation
where I can't predict the outcome:

1. What do I think is the worst possible realistic outcome of the situation?
2. How will I feel about it?
3. What will I do about it?

I've seen the value of applying these questions both in my professional and
personal capacity.

When I explore the absolute worst realistic outcome I can think of, I've
given the situation deliberate thought and processed a way to deal with how I
feel about it and how I can overcome it.

> I am an old man and I have known a great many troubles, but most of them
  never happened. ~ Mark Twain

It's actually rare that the worst outcome will materialize so just by thinking
about it I am equipped to take on whatever comes my way without getting worked
up about it.
