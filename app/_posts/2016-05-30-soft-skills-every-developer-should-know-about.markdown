  "We only grow when we are doing things that makes us uncomfortable." by
  John Sonmez
tags: mindset

I have been following [John Sonmez](http://www.simpleprogrammer.com)
for a while now. He has personally guided and motivated me during the
conception of my blog.

I never really focused on my people skills until I was exposed to a lot
of people when I joined a corporate in 2014. I was intrigued.

Integrating with technologies and writing software for me is relatively
easy but getting people to work cohesively together is more challenging.

On 24 May 2016, John Sonmez gave a talk at Xamarin Evolve 2016
called "5 Soft Skills Every Software Developer Should Know" which I'd
like to share today.

He wrote that it's about mindset and overcoming your fears. I absolutely
love his talk because I can
[relate](/blog/escaping-the-social-comfort-zone/)
so much to it.
